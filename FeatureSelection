Proposed Project Ideas from 1-12-17 email:
Idea 1
-Use ML to predict whether USAID will distribute economic aid to a country in future years. The Country Summary data 
on this web page would be a starting point. It'd also be great if we could use change in aid amounts to predict 
how much a country would receive.

Idea 2
Use ML to predict whether a plant will get a disease - something similar to this research: http://www.ikg.uni-bonn.de/uploads/tx_ikgpublication/Dissertation_Rumpf.pdf

I have to thank you for heading me in a good direction as far as usage of data (data for the good of the world).
The following is what I have gathered as our initial tasks. Feel free to update the list.
1.      Identify the datasets

2.      If we pick more than one dataset, how to join them.

3.      Identify the features â€“ Decide how/if we derive feature (convert ratio types to discrete types or reduce the number of discrete values, etc.).

4.      What question are we going to answer.

USAID Data from Laura: https://explorer.usaid.gov/data.html (Country Summary CSV data)

The data catalog for the World Bank:
It was my first time there, so I am not familiar with the datasets.  Below is what I could gather quickly. If you already have the knowledge of your way around the World Bank Catalog, or if you find datasets that might better suit our needs, please feel free to update.

Datasets that might be of interest:

-------
1/17/17 - We decided to go with Project Idea 1 and have run it by our TA for approval. She says project details will be released after Spring break 
(March 13) so we've got a head start.

1/18/17 - Laura has a call into USAID Economic Analysis and Data Services Director to see if this research is needed/ relevant for
the development community. Also, cursory research shows that this analysis has not been done to date.
2/1/17 - USAID Data steward confirmed no research of this kind exists that they're aware of and want to be kept 
up-to-date with project findings

-We don't want to overfit the data so the challenge will be choosing our features for the ML model wisely.
-Represent multi-dimensional vector as an array in Python: 
cs23ln.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial

1/19/17: USAID Domain expert recommends deleting military expenditures from analysis due to political reasons. States there is no
known research of this type.
1/19/17: Majid creates DropBox with all data files and sets up permissions access

1/24/17: Laura uploads CSV file to DropBox Majid sets up and explains how columns were determined.
Perhaps also add "World Development Index" feature column from World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?end=2015&locations=AL&start=2015&view=bar
) to USAID data set - 

2/3/17 -decided to go with World Bank GDP annual growth% since there is more complete data for all countries -also this compares the country against itself
- will not use Millennium Challenge Corporation data since they only have data for 46/189 countries -they work in 24% of all countries USAID works in
-Majid created metadata file for USAID data using Excel headings
-we decided to join USAID & World Bank data sets (manually in Excel sadly) to see if there 
was a correlation between GDP growth rate, and predicted foreign aid amount over 10 million US
-We did not include other non-government organizations such as private foundations, etc but chose to 
specifically focus on the top two government aid organizations

2/6/17: Missing data -- how much is this an issue? 
3/23/17: Missing data not a big issue if we choose the right classifier carefully

2/7/17: 2016 data became available so that will be added to data set (missing 42 country's data disbursement amount)
Sorted existing cleaned data set to try to see if 10 million US$ was an appropriate threshold for the feature
Since 101/188 countries received this amount (53%), we decided this was an appropriate threshold
Do not want to overfit the model
-Deleted Austria, Bermuda, Finland, Kiribata, Tuvalu since no data for 2014 or 2016
-Deleted Macau, New Zealand, Serbia and Montenegro(former), Surinam, Sweden since no data for 2015 or 2016
-Deleted Guyana and Kosovo since no data for 2014 or 2015
-If country is not listed, it doesn't receive USAID dollars
USAID aid selection criteria documentation uploaded to DropBox

3/22/17: Found out about 'Human Development Index' metric from UN (that includes per capita, life expectancy & educatioln
factors in its calculation) ; http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi; Decided not to include this as a feature in model to keep a simple model for hopeful imporved accuracy

3/30/17: Decided not to use Human Development Index as a variable since it's calculated--want to reduce human error in algorithm
as much as possible

3/31/17: Conversation with Majid--need to figure out how to load data from web api, then convert from JSON to CSV-
http://blog.danwin.com/examples-of-web-scraping-in-python-3-x-for-data-journalists/
Have sent email to TA requesting project requirements as project is due 5-4-17
--Will need to convert multiple variables to array using list of lists
