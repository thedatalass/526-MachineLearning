The original dataset has 20,703 examples of money given by USAID to foreign countries for economic and military assistance with year categories: 2015 (776 examples) and 2014 (706 examples). Features (see also World Bank for category explanations) include region (East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa), aid category (Economic, Military), aid distributed (obligations, disbursements), aid received in last year, actual amount > $10 m US, and actual amount < $10 US.  
A machine learning algorithm could predict whether next yearâ€™s aid amount will be greater than $10 million US.
